# You [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/v0nblgg1fq3g0fnb)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lowjoel/main)
The You Task Management Application.

## Developing You
You will need:

- Visual Studio 2013

To build this on your local machine:

1. `git clone https://github.com/cs2103aug2014-w10-1c/main.git`
2. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Open `You.sln` using Visual Studio
4. NuGet packages will be downloaded on first compile

It might also be useful to install [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/),
since that is what we use to standardise our code style.

Developer documentation is rebuilt after every push to our main repository, and
can be found at http://cs2103aug2014-w10-1c.github.io/you-documentation/
